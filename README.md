# Transport-System-v1
Java project for facilitating students in registering to NUST transport system. To ensure that the students are informed about unavailability of route or seat before they have to fill the registration form, we have designed a program that reads the data and checks the available seats and routes. All data is stored in excel sheets. Moreover, a session for the administrator is also made where administrator can add or remove routes, vans and students.
